The is a short document that outlines the functionality of Java Calculus.

Keys 

* Plot, Contin, Taylor, and Root keys require an expression to be entered prior to pressing any of these buttons.
* Evaluate key the expression entered
* SP key is used to escape subscript or superscript operations. For example after entering 'lim' the app automatically goes into subscript mode to allow you to enter scope (such as x -> 0). To exit subscript mode enter SP.


Below are examples of expression that can be evalutated in script mode. These examples along with screenshots provided on homepage may be used as guide to use application.



println(6 + 6);
PI * PI;
COS(3 * PI / 2);
LN(3);
LN(f(3));

//factorial demonstration
4!;

//plot
plot 23 * x ^ 2 + 6 * x ^ 3 for x in [3 : 6];


//limit demonstration
limit( x ^ 3 as x -> 0);
limit( (x ^ 3) / SIN(x) as x -> 0);
limit(  SIN(x) / x as x -> 0);


//root withing range demonstration 
root(  x ^ 2 - x for x in [ 1 : 5 ]);

//Demonstrates differentiation
DIFF( x ^ 2 /2: x);
DIFF(SEC(x): x , 2);

//Integration
INT(x ^ 2: x );

//Taylor series demonstration
TAYLOR(SIN(x): x , 3 , 2);

//continuity at a point
CONT( x ^ 2 as x -> 0);
CONT( (x ^ 2) / x as x -> 0);
CONT( if x < 2 then x ^ 2 else  if x >= 2 then x ^ 3 as x -> 2);
